# `ExtendedButtons`
![](https://github.com/Krypton-Suite/Documentation/blob/main/Assets/Extended-Toolkit/Buttons.png?raw=true)

## Things of note in the picture
- x2 Command link style buttons
- x2 Types of dropdown buttons - x1 normal button + x1 elevated button
- x2 Types of elevated buttons
- x1 `KryptonViewButtons`

## Usage
- Drag and drop control on a `KryptonForm`
- With the UAC enabled buttons, you don't need to invoke the `Click()` event, as all elevation code is handled within the button itself
- Command link buttons require design configuration on the developers' part

# ToDo
- Drop-in dialog buttons w/ elevation options
